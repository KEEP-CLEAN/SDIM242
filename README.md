# Weclcome to KEEP CLEAN’s secret base！

## We have three sections altogether, and I will introduce each one to you



### 1.Code for final presentation
#### This section is basically the final product of our code, and there are only three main files, namely
##### a）transmit 
##### b)recipt signal
##### c)drive motor 



### 2.Individual
#### We put code of bitesize here. Thus, this section witnessed every group memebers' progress.



### 3.Pictures
#### This is where we used to keep our photos. However, NAS is a better place to store, so there aren't many pictures here
